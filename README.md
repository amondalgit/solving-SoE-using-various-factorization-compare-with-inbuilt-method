#### **Experiment with various pivoting strategies for Gaussian elimination and Cholesky factorization in solving of System of Equations. You will also compare the results of your algorithms with the ones obtained using SciPy's solvers.**

1. **GEPP** (Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting)
2. **GERP** (Gaussian Elimination with Rook Pivoting)
3. **GECP** (Gaussian Elimination with Complete Pivoting)
4. **CHOP** (Cholesky factorization with Pivoting)
